#  OBJECTIVE

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/demands/objective.png)](http://travis-ci.org/demands/objective)

Your go-to node module for creating [test fixtures or mock
objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object "Everything you wanted to know about mock objects")!
Also great for all sorts of complex object instantiation!

## TODOs

### Things that should exist:

- clean, easy, obvious syntax
  (see https://gist.github.com/justinabrahms/81645db1b0262aa36b9b)

### Ability to:

- overwrite array parameters
- make use of other factories in your factory
- set options that your object creation function can use
- have the mock object have a certain prototype (and even run a constructor
  function)
- optionally, automatically have that mock object be persisted in the database


## Installation

```
npm install objective --save
```
